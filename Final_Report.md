# Introduction

Psoriasis is an autoimmune-like disease isolated mainly to the skin that
affects around 125 million individuals across the globe (Griffiths *et
al.*, 2017). The disease manifests itself as itchy and inflamed lesions
on the skin that grow excessively. These lesions appear in various parts
of the body on individuals and can be so severe that they can cover
large portions of the body such as the entire back or on extremities.
These lesion can prove quite bothersome to individuals as they may
constantly scratch the lesions, further agitating the area and worsening
the disease. Moreover, this scratching can even lead to breaking down of
the skin barrier, which acts as a first defense against pathogens. By
reducing this defense, it allows for a greater chance of pathogen
introduction, putting the individual at greater risk for infection
(Bartenjev *et al.*, 2000). Older therapies such as Goeckerman therapy
and bleach baths, usually used in atopic dermatitis, have been used to
treat the symptoms, stopping growth of the skin or killing bacteria that
may irritate the lesions (Gupta *et al.*, 2013; Huang *et al.*, 2009).
Despite their relative success, the treatments are more short term and
do not actively address the problem of immune dysfunction within the
skin. Recent therapies such as Ustekinumab have be introduced that
specifically target pathways in the immune response to avoid this
overactive immune behavior, and consequently stop the lesions all
together (McKeage, 2014).

The pathophysiology of psoriasis is heavily mediated by the immune
system, specifically T cell. Keratinocytes are triggered by a factors
such as stress, which induces them to release cytokines (Lande *et al.*,
2007). These cytokines then activate T cells, namely Th1 and Th17, which
further enhance this immune response by releasing more cytokines that
introduces other immune cells. This activation leads to inflammation
within the lesion microenvironment, which further triggers keratinocytes
to start actively proliferating, a response usually induced to shed
possible pathogens. Since this initiation of the immune response is
heavily initiated by T cells, studying these cells are a major area of
interest. Specifically what may be of interest is how these cells are
affected in terms of their typical cellular functions. Many cellular
functions in the immune system have been researched as being key to
immune function. Changes in these critical cellular processes may be key
to the dysfunction seen in many autoimmune disease, including psoriasis.
Cell adhesion is a key process that enables the physical movement of
immune cells into the blood vessels and to sites of inflammation via
cell receptors such as selectins (Afanasiev *et al.*, 2013). Cytokines
and their chemokine subsets are a major signaling proteins in the immune
system that can trigger inflammation and homing of immune cells to
specific sites (Baliwag *et al.*, 2015; Lee and Hwang, 2012). Inhibitory
mechanisms such as CTLA4 and PD1 are major receptors involved in
inhibition of immune cells in disease like cancer, dampening the immune
system (Hernandez-Chacon *et al.*, 2011; Krummel, 1995). Lastly, cell
proliferation via clonal expansion of immune such as T and B cells are
what largely drive the inflammation as more inflammatory cells are
produced (Denizot *et al.*, 1986; Prakken *et al.*, 2000). Taken
together, these functions are critical in the immune response, and any
dysfunction in these would likely have some degree of effect in normal
immune function in disease such as psoriasis.

Given that there are so many key processes used by the immune system, we
decide that we wanted to look closer at these in psoriasis. Specifically
we wanted to see how they were affected in psoriasis, and if there were
any major changes between subtypes. In order to investigate this, we
looked at major differences in these processes on the genetic level. We
did so by using the RNA sequencing data originally generated by (Ahn *et
al.*, 2018) from active psoriasis lesions and healthy control. They
specifically looked at the psoriasis lesions from patients with
conventional psoriasis, palmoplantar psoriasis, and scalp psoriasis to
look for any molecular changes. All of these subtypes differ mainly in
the location to which the lesions are expressed, indicating some likely
different immune dysfunction phenotypes. Moving forward with this idea,
we looked at how cellular processes were affected in psoriasis in
general. We then honed in specifically on the major process affected and
sought to understand how these differed specifically across the
different psoriasis types. We hypothesized that cell adhesion mechanisms
will be reduced, likely in regulatory populations, and migration,
inhibition, inflammation, and proliferation mechanisms will be
increased, likely in the effector and regulatory populations, in
psoriasis so as to favor the autoimmune response. We further built on
this and hypothesized that the degree to which these are affected will
different between psoriasis type so as favor the phenotype that is key
in that specific disease. All together, we aim to gain better
understanding in the processes affected in psoriasis and how these may
be slightly altered between different subtypes. We hope that these
finding may shed some more light onto the exact mechanisms affected in
each subtype so that more targeted therapies can be created to
specifically treat the exact dysfunctionalities in each subtype.

# Methods

## Study design

The original aim (Ahn *et al.*, 2018) was to identify the heterogeneity
on molecular level with in psoriasis patients. They did so by using
RNA-Seq in order to identify the differences in gene expression as well
as flow cytometry to quantify T cell make-up. Their study essentially
consisted of isolating skin samples from psoriasis patients and healthy
control skin to extract the RNA and analyze the cells via flow
cytometry. The design consisted of 3 experimental groups: scalp
psoriasis, palmoplantar psoriasis, and conventional plaque psoriasis. A
control group was included as well using a healthy control group. Two 4
mm samples were taken from the active psoriatic lesions of the
experimental group skin and from the healthy control skin. For each skin
sample, 1 biopsy was used for RNA-Seq analysis and the other was used
for flow cytometry analysis. The individuals from which the psoriatic
skin was obtained were at least 18 years old and were confirmed to have
psoriasis for a minimum of 6 months. Individuals with psoriasis were not
on systemic treatments and abstained from topical treatments for at
least 2 weeks so as to not interfere with the data. The study design
allowed for the comparison of all psoriasis types between each other as
well as with healthy controls

## Sample origin and sequencing

For the experimental groups, a total of 19 patients with psoriasis were
recruited from the San Francisco Bay area. Of these patients, 8 had
conventional plaque psoriasis, 8 had scalp psoriasis, and 3 had
palmoplantar psoriasis. Two 4 mm punch biopsies were taken from active
lesions on the trunk and extremities of the conventional plaque
psoriasis, on the scalp of scalp psoriasis patients, and on the hand or
foot of the palmoplantar psoriasis patients. For the control group, skin
was isolated from the trunk or upper legs of 9 patients. The healthy
control skin was obtained from the surgical discards as a results of
cosmetic surgery performed on these patients. The biopsies for RNA-Seq
were placed in RNALater to preserve the RNA. The biopsies for flow
cytometry were placed on gauze dampened with phosphate buffered saline
to keep the skin hydrated. All biopsies were then stored at 4 °C until
processing of the samples.

The RNA was extracted from the biopsies started in RNALater using first
the Qiagen Allprep DNA/RNA mini kit. Once extracted, quality control and
identification of mRNA with little degradation was performed on the
Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer in order to filter out any suboptimal mRNA that
may interfere with analysis. The quality mRNA that was not discarded was
then prepared into a library either the Ovation RNA-Seq System V2
protocol (Nugen) or the Ribozero (Illumina) kits. The prepared libraries
were then sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq platform (Metzker, 2010). The
reads obtained were paired-end and maintained a 100 bp length.

## Computational

The data from (Ahn *et al.*, 2018) used for this analysis were download
from the Gene Expression Omnibus using the accession number GSE117405
using the SRA toolkit. The FASTQ files were then used to perform quality
control of the reads within the files based on the quality scores
assigned to the reads. This allowed for the visualization of suboptimal
quality regions of reads. The trimmomatic program was used to then
identify these lower quality regions of reads and trim them if their
quality score begins to fall below the threshold of 15 (Bolger *et al.*,
2014). Once the reads were cleaned to avoid errors from read sequences,
the data was then ready for further processing. The human reference
genome, transcripts, and annotation were downloaded from the NCBI RefSeq
database in order to align the trimmed reads to the genome in order to
identify the genes expressed. The biomartr program was used to download
these data as it allows for a controlled and reproducible manner of
retrieving such information (Drost and Paszkowski, 2017). Once this data
was obtained, the reads were ready to be aligned. The sailfish package
was used in order to index the reads and align them to the provided
reference genome (Patro *et al.*, 2014). Counts of these aligned reads
were then generated using the same package. These aligned transcripts
were then identified via their GenBank IDs, which were used to obtain
the gene names of these transcripts. Counts were ultimately consolidated
into a singled gene count table containing normalized and non-normalized
gene counts which could be used for analysis.

The prepared data table was then analyzed in RStudio to produce the
graphs here. Data was manipulated to look at expression of genes of
interest via normalized counts across the conditions to see changes in
psoriasis and the types of psoriasis. The non-normalized counts were
also used to perform differential analysis via DESeq2 for figure 2 in
order to cluster samples based on the top 1000 gene differentially
expressed genes (Love *et al.*, 2014).

# Results

## Subsections are ok in the results section too

We first wanted to identify the major cell mechanisms affected in
psoriasis in general, specifically cell adhesion, cytokines, chemokines,
inhibition, and proliferation. We looked at the gene sets involved in
these mechanisms to see which mechansims were upregulated or
downregulated. We calculate fold changes in expression to see how
upregulated or downregulated certain processes were in psoriasis in
general.

**Figure 1**: Bar plot of major gene set involved in key cellular
processes that are upregulated or downregulated in psoriasis.

We first found that the expression levels of most of these cellular
processes were largely affected, except for two. Specifically,
proliferation, inhibition, and chemokines were all largely upregulated
(figure 1). Meanwhile, cell adhesion was one process that was largely
downregulated (figure 1). Proinflammatory cytokines trended towards
downregulation and proinflammatory cytokine receptors trended towards
upregulation, but not enough to keep moving forward with these (figure
1). Using this information, we decided to look more closely at those
processes that were largely affected across the different psoriasis
types.

Before moving forward and looking more in-depth at these cellular
processes, we decided to look more closely into the differen subtypes in
general. We wnated to gain more insight into these subtypes and gain
some more information on exactly how they relate. More specifically, we
wanted to see how exactly similar they were and if they showed some
distinct
phenotypes.

<img src="Final_Report_files/figure-gfm/figure-2-PCA-Plot-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

**Figure 2**: PCA plot of the 4 sample groups to infer how the
phenotypes of psoriasis differ based on the top 100 differentially
expressed genes.

In order to gain some idea of relatedness between the psoriasis
subtypes, we used a principal component analysis approach to calculate
the differential expression of the top 1000 variably expressed genes.
Using this allowed us to infer some idea of relatedness based on the
difference in expression of certain genes. We saw that there was some
degree of agregation across the psoriasis subtypes (Figure 2). The
healthy controls congregated cleanly together (Figure 2). The subtypes
congregated to some extent but there was some overlap between
conventional psoriasis and scalp psoriasis (Figure 2). Moreover, the
points within each group varied largely on the PC1 axis (Figure 2).

Now that we had some idea of relatedness, we then moved forward as
stated before. We bgan by looking at the upregulation or down regulation
via fold change acorss the different subtypes to see how these chnaged.
We wanted to see if there were many changes from one subtypes to
another.

**Figure 3**: Heatmap looking at the fold change expression of
inhibitory ligands and cytokines amongst the psoriasis subtypes.

We began by looking at the fold change expression of inhibitory ligands
and cytokines to see how their expression changed. We found that there
was an overall upregulation as in figure 1 (Figure 3). There was some
degree of variability in the expression of this upregulation, however,
for many the genes (Figure 3). Additionally, there were some genes that
were downregulated overall such as CD160 and even one gene that was
slightly downregulated in only palmoplantar psoriasis, LGALS9 (Figure
3).

<img src="Final_Report_files/figure-gfm/figure-4-heatmap-inhibitory-receptors-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

**Figure 4**: Heatmap looking at the fold change expression of
inhibitory receptors amongst the psoriasis subtypes.

We then moved to look at the fold change expression of inhibitory
receptors across the subtypes. We found an overall upregulation as well,
similar to figure 1 (Figure 4). There was much less variability in the
degree of upregulation of these genes across the subtypes (Figure 4).
Despite this, HAVCR2 was one gene that was slightly downregulated in
only palmoplantar psoriasis and scalp psoriasis (Figure
4).

<img src="Final_Report_files/figure-gfm/figure-5-heatmap-chemokine-receptors-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

**Figure 5**: Heatmap looking at the fold change expression of chemokine
receptors amongst the psoriasis subtypes.

After inhibition, we started to analyze expression of chemokines,
specfically their receptors. There was mainly upregulation of these
genes for all subtypes, but there was also some downregulation of
certain genes as well such as CCR10, CCR9, and CXCR5 that was seen for
all three (figure 5). Again, the degree to which these were expressed
varied across subtype (figure 5). Additionally, CCR3, CCR6, and CCR8
were some receptors that were down regulated in only specific subtypes
(figure
5).

<img src="Final_Report_files/figure-gfm/figure-6-heatmap-chemokines-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

**Figure 6**: Heatmap looking at the fold change expression of
chemokines amongst the psoriasis subtypes.

We then analyzed expression of chemokines for these chemokine receptors.
There was very minimal downregulation of all chemokines looked at for
all subtypes, with some variability (figure 6). However, there were some
major upregulated chemokines for specific subtypes. CXCL10 and CXCL9
were upregulated mainly in palmoplantar psoriasis while CXCL13 was
mainly upregulated in conventianl psoriasis (figure 6). There was also
some upregulation of certain chemokines for all subtypes, but to a much
less extent than these previous ones mentioned (figure
6).

<img src="Final_Report_files/figure-gfm/figure-7-heatmap-adhesion-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

**Figure 7**: Heatmap looking at the fold change expression of adhesion
molecules amongst the psoriasis subtypes.

We finally looked at the expression of adhesion molecules and found that
there was a mix of upregulation and downregulation, but downregualtion
was more prominent (figure 7). These expression levels were seen
similarly across all the subtypes with some variability (figure 7).
There were some genes such as ICAM5 and ITGA10 that were downregulated
in only palmoplantar psoriasis and scalp psoriasis that was not seen in
conventional psoriasis (figure 7).
